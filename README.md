## Description

This repository is created to practice and learn [Extreme Programming](https://asana.com/es/resources/extreme-programming-xp) concepts such as Test Driven Development or Pair Programming, among others.

The project will have one folder per kata to avoid creating several repositories. Each folder will contain:
- A **README.md** file explaining kata's requirements and what concepts will be practiced.
- The initial **.py** files for writing initial code and its tests.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The objective of the katas is not to finish all of them, what we want to do is to practice our coding skills.
> Remember this while coding and don't worry if a kata leaves unfinished.
